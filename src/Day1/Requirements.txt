Problem Statement:
You're building a simple user registration system. Each user has a name, age, and email. You need to:

1. Define a struct called User with fields:
        Name (string)
        Age (int)
        Email (string)

2. Write a function NewUser(name string, age int, email string) (*User, error) that:
    Returns an error if:
            name is empty
            age is less than 0 or greater than 150
            email doesn't contain "@" (simple validation)
            Otherwise, returns a pointer to a new User.

3. Write a method IsAdult() on the User struct that returns true if age â‰¥ 18.

4. In the main() function:
        Declare variables for name, age, and email using short declaration (:=)
        Call NewUser() and handle the error
        If no error, print:
        "User created: <name>"
        "Is adult: true/false"
